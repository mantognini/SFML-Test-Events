# SFML-Test-Events

Small program made to test events and window features of SFML

Everything of interest is in `Test Events/main.cpp`. An Xcode project is
available but this project should also work on other platform or without
Xcode. Just make sure the `resourcePath()` function is properly defined.

If needed, you can update the settings of the Xcode project to match
your version of SFML. Follow the instruction
[here](https://github.com/SFML/SFML/blob/master/tools/xcode/templates/readme.txt#L107-L127).

This project is licenced under zlib.
