# SFML-Test-Events

Small program made to test events and window features of SFML

Everything of interest is in `Test Events/main.cpp`. An Xcode project is
available but this project should also work on other platform or without
Xcode. Just make sure the `resourcePath()` function is properly defined.

This project is licenced under zlib.
